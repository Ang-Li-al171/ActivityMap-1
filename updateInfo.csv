"1","-Added in User Guide tab for the app for better User experience.
-Used tables for displaying individual object interaction data in a neater manner.
-now using GitHub for source code sharing."
"2","-Added in frequency heat map for Position Stats and object Stats
-Available in Main Window and Object Interaction Tab
-Light color means smaller values for frequencies, negative/smaller values for changes"
"3","-Added in another plot type for Position and Object Interaction plots -- plot by aggregate frequency
-The buildings will be shaded based on frequency of visits in position map
-They will be shaded based on frequency of object interactions in those buildings
-The numbers beside building names are the frequency counts
-Try not to use this type for All Subjects over extended period of time, because it takes time to process"
"4","-Edited some titles and text for clarity"
"5","-Added a Pos.Total column and a Item.Total column for the frequency heat map
-Added a Bubble Chart under Position Tab, which tracks the changes in Weight and HBA1C for chosen subjects, with the circles sized based on Activity
-Activity is defined to be 0.5 * Number of Position Data + 0.5 * Number of Item Data
-Some circles are missing due to incomplete clinical data"
"6","-Modified the bubble chart. The baseline bubbles are now all of the same size. The M6 bubbles are sized based on each avatars activity during the six months
-Optimized frequency heatmap for both position and object interaction with a Blue-Red color scale together with a specified legend
-Moved text for Aggregate Frequency plot so that all numbers and text can be seen clearly"
