,x1,"This application is for visualizing data associated with Constance Johnson and Allison Vorderstrasse's ""Second Life Impacts Diabetes Education and Self-management"" (SLIDES) research project."2,"The position heat map draws data points for the subjects chosen on the left panel. Points will only be drawn for the time period specified by the user, through time period selection by either DayCount or RealDate. Legend for the points are displayed at the bottom of each page, whereby each subject is specified by a color together with a shape symbol."3,"The object heap map draws data points for the subjects chosen on the left, not for their avatars' position but for the position of the objects they touched during the time period selected. At the top of the side bar, you can choose to plot by subjects, whereby each subject will have a distinct color and symbol, or to plot by object types, whereby each type of object will be distinguishable from one another. As usual, the legend will be below the plot. You may also choose to view the detailed information of objects touched, as well as statistics about the number of each type of objects touched by the chosen subjects through the checkboxes on the side bar."4,"The conversation map will display position data points with an additional feature of showing the frequency count of conversations at each location. The position data corresponds to the subjects chosen on the left, but the conversation count is the total number of conversations during the specified time period, because we have yet discovered who were involved in each conversation. From the drop-down list on the left you will be able to select a conversation during the chosen time period, and detailed information about this conversation, including possible subjects involved according to avatar position data, will be available in a text box below the map."5,This feature is only available in private mode whereby confidential clinical and survey data of the chosen subjects collected during the research will be available.
