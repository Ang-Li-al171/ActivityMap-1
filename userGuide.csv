,x1,"This application displays visualizations of data collected in Constance Johnson and Allison Vorderstrasse's ""Second Life Impacts Diabetes Education and Self-management"" (SLIDES) research project."2,"The Avatar Position map shows avatar locations for the subjects whose checkboxes are selected on the left panel for the user-specified time period. Time period may be selected by either DayCount or RealDate. A legend is displayed at the bottom of each page whereby each subject is uniquely identified by the combination of a color together with a shape symbol."3,"The Object Interactions map shows for the subjects chosen on the left the positions of the objects they touched during the time period selected. At the top of the panel on the left you can choose By Subject whereby each subject will have a distinct color and symbol or By Object Type whereby each type of object will be distinguishable from one another. As usual the legend will be below the plot. You may also choose to view detailed information about objects touched as well as statistics about the number of each type of objects touched by the subjects chosen with the checkboxes on the side bar."
4,"The Conversations map displays avatar positions plus the number of conversations at each location. These positions refer to which subjects are chosen on the left but the conversation count is the total number of conversations during the specified time period because we don't yet know who participated in each conversation. From the¬ù drop-down list on the left you may select a conversation during the chosen time period and see additional information about this conversation displayed in a text box beneath the map. This information includes subjects that might have participated in the selected conversation based on avatar position data."
5,"This feature is only available in private mode whereby confidential data for the chosen subjects is available."
